= Infinispan HTTP/2 demo

In Infinispan 9.0.2 we introduced HTTP/2 support for REST (you may look into https://youtu.be/wR3o6HA47Ao[unRESTful Web Services with HTTP2 by Fabian St√§ber] video for more information). This demo shows how to use with JDK9 HTTP client (which supports HTTP/2 out of the box).
